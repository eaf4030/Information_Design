# Information Design



## Introduction

Platfrom can descide how much information about the trips disclose to drivers.
1. **Full Information Disclosure:** Platform disclose all the information of trips
 * Higher Quality of Match: the drivers make informed decision and this increase the value of working and increase the supply in return.
 * Longer wiating time for riders and other drivers: Drivers reject many rides to find the ones which has enough value for them. Therefore, the acceptace rate goes down and the riders have to wait longer to find the ride. Some of them might not find ny ride at all.


2. **No Information Disclosure:** Platform disclose no information about trips
  * Higher match rate: driver who are active accept all rides because they do not know anything about them so the waiting time for riders goes down.
  * Since drivers so not make informed decision, the value of working decreases. In return, the hours of working might go sown (Intensive margin) and the churn rate of drivers might also reduces (Extensive margin)


## Research Question:

What is the optimal amount infromation that the platform should disclose to increase the riders welfare?


## Road Map

1. I model the demand for passenger using ridehailing who goes from A to B at the hour of the day h. I estimate the riders price elasticity and sensitivity to the pick up time.

2. I model drivers trip choices and decision to exit the market. I quantify their reservation wage during the day and different location. Drivers are heterogenous with different preferred location and lesiure cost.

## Data
each rider after setting the destination observes the price and decides to request the ride or not (Step one)
after the platform found the driver, the pick up time is shown to rider and she can decide to cancel or keep the ride (step two)

This part shows some data descibtion of riders and drivers behaviors

## Demand


Model:
I create a two step model. In the first step, it models the binary choice of requesting or not and in the second step the binary choice of canceling or not.
Since I only observe the second choice, the data is endogenous sample and a simple binary choice model estimation is bias.
